# synthetic-data-generation-w-faker

# Overview

This program is a comprehensive synthetic data modeling and simulation application built with Streamlit. It integrates data generation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and evaluation into an interactive user interface, enabling users to create synthetic datasets and analyze them efficiently.

The application uses libraries like Faker for data generation, Streamlit for the interface, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. Users can input parameters to customize the data generation process, explore the dataset, build regression models, and visualize model performance.

# Features

1. Synthetic Data Generation

- Generate customizable synthetic datasets using the Faker library.

- Include features such as numerical values, categorical labels, and date-based variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize the dataset using pair plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.

- Analyze statistical summaries and relationships between features.

3. Machine Learning Modeling

- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

- Train a Random Forest regression model on the synthetic data.

- Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

4. Simulation and Evaluation

- Predict outcomes using the trained model.

- Visualize predictions against true values with scatter plots.

5. Interactive Streamlit Interface

- Allow users to select parameters such as the number of samples, features, and target distributions.

- Display dynamic visualizations and evaluation results.
